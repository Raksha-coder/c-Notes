ðŸ¤©Dependency Injection 

what is dependency ? what is coupling? why do we use dependency injection?
When One class depend on another class for their properties and Methods,this leads to Coupling. In coupling there is high maintenance cost because if I change something in parent class, the changes should be visible in all other classes that are depend on that parent class so developer introduce dependency injection design pattern to reduce coupling between classes. It provide dependencies to classes without high coupling and it can be implemented without any third party library.
